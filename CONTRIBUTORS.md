# Contributors List

This is the list of the application's significant contributors.

This does not necessarily list everyone who has contributed code,
especially since many employees of one corporation may be contributing.
To see the full list of contributors, see the revision history in
source control. New contributors should add their name and email
address to this file with their first pull request.
